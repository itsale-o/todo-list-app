## Overview

This project is a to-do list application built entirely with python using Django.

### The Project

How does it work? Like any other "to-do list". Users should be able to:

- Add a new task to their task list;
- Edit an existing task;
- Delete a task (for whatever reason they want to);
- Mark a task as completed;
- Look for a specific task with the search bar by using a key word.

### Screenshot

This is how the app looks like.

**Login:** the first thing the users will see:

**SignUp:** if the users don't have an account, they can create one:

  ![signup](./tasks/static/images/sign-up.png)

</div>

**Homepage:** once logged in the users will see their homepage with all their tasks:

  ![homepage](./tasks/static/images/home.png)

</div>

**Details:** the users can see the details fot their tasks by clicking on them. On a real scenario they'll probably see dates, hours, locations and relevant details in general.
